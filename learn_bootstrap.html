		<h1>Peter Myers</h1>
	</div>


		<p>Hi, I'm a Business Intelligence Engineer interested in learning new applications for programming and statistics.  I enjoy playing pool and longboarding.</p>
		<p>
			I'm interested in programming video games and most excited about making smart AI, machine learning, and ETL.
		</p>
		<h3>Automatically Write Essay</h3>
		<p>
			One programming project I undertook was writing a program, which would read in a text file for a book and output a scrambled version of that book.  It would find all possible words that come after each word, and assign a random word from that list to come after that word.  The sentences were creative combinations of portions of the book.
		</p>
		<h3>Morse Code App</h3>
		<p>
			I was working on a morse code application which will convert text into morse code and then play the morse code.  You can download it and type in your name to hear your name in morse code.
		</p>
		<h3>Sliding Puzzle Game</h3>
		<p>
			A fun puzzle is the sliding puzzle.  This can be found on my GitHub page under Game-Clones.  You move the pieces until they are all in the right order.
		</p>
		<h3>Javascript Survey Builder</h3>
		<p>
			If you need to ask a coworker for some answers to your questions but want to give them time to answer them, you can give them a survey.  This survey will allow you to customize aesthetics and content.
		</p>
		<h3>Javascript Codify - Code Builder</h3>
		<p>
			If you would rather code using buttons instead of typing out all the commands, this copy-paste-like program called Codify may help.  You build up your button statements over time and place them in here.  Ideally this could be saved in local storage.  You have the ability to organize the buttons by position and color.  I sometimes have a lot of code I need to copy-paste or type, so it is useful to have some type of tool for this.  This can be found on my codepen page, and there is a link on my GitHub page.
		</p>
		<h3>Java Swing Toolikit</h3>
		<p>
			I was working on a Java swing tool.  It's primary purpose is to take code from the clipboard and replace the variables.  It's secondary purpose is to provide regularly used pieces of code to my clipboard.
		</p>
		<h3>Javascript todo list</h3>
		<p>
			I was working on a To do list early on.  I had trouble with resizing and CSS styling, which seems much easier with Bootstrap.  This program uses local storage so you can come back later and see your to do list.  This can be found on my codepen page, and there is a link on my GitHub page.
		</p>
		<h3>Spark</h3>
		<p>
			A very useful and flexible tool for computation is Spark.  It runs 10 times faster on disk and 100 times faster on memory than map reduce.  Map reduce is the method used in extracting, transforming, and loading data.  A job that would have taken an hour can be run in a few minutes.  Here are examples of doing word counts using Spark.
		</p>
		<h3>Advance Wars</h3>
		<p>
			I worked to create Advance Wars and am working to get a working AI.  It is a turn based strategy game.  I felt like it was almost done for the longest time, so I couldn't stop working on it until it worked.  What I learned most from it was working with multi-threading and working with graph search.  The game consists of two sides each trying to capture the other's base.  You build four types of units: infantry, mechs, artillery, and tanks.  Infantry are cheap, average speed, capture buildings, and do well against infantry and mech.  Mech are kind of cheap, slow, good against all units, and can capture buildings.  Artillery attack at a range, move above average speed, are expensive, must stand still on the turn they attack, can attack without being counter attacked, and are so strong against all units that they have been weakened to do less damage to avoid making them overpowered.  The tanks move fast, do well against all but average against mechs, probably can take on a dozen infantry and come out ahead, are expensive.  My strategy would probably involve making many artillery and protecting them with infantry, but since that might be overpowered, I may weaken artillery more in the future or change the map to have more paths and less choke points.  This game is free to download from GitHub and is ready to be played with a friend.  The AI is in progress.  The AI will work by having an algorithm that counts up the points based on perhaps around six factors.  These might include, expected cost/benefit of making an attack on an enemy, points for being closer to the enemy base, points for avoiding the enemy's artillery range, points for capturing buildings, points for repairing units with 6 of 10 or less health, and having a good unit ratio related to the enemy, number of buildings, their own units already.  Each of these would generate a score and these overall scores would be altered with differents weights to find the best result.  The AI would try all combinations during each move and choose the move with the best score.  The units would have a really low score for standing on bases, and the bases would build units last on the turn.  This can be found on my GitHub page under Game-Clones.

		<h3>Memory Puzzle</h3>
		<p>
			The memory puzzle game tests your memory with anywhere between a dozen and 100 cards.  This can be found on my GitHub page under Game-Clones.
		</p>
		<h3>Dodger</h3>
		<p>
			Dodger is a game about dodging objects.  The game settings and be updated to increase the spawn rate of the objects flying at you.  This can be found on my GitHub page under Game-Clones.
		</p>
		<h3>Time Management</h3>
		<p>
			Time management is very important.  Some useful tips are having only 6 areas where you store the things you need to process.  My areas are a computer folder, my phone notes, evernote, voicemail, work scrum board, and email.  To process information you have to ask: What do I need to do next?  When does it need to be done?  Where does this belong next?  Another useful tip is to have one email for work and all personal emails.  If you get spam, create filters to move those out of your inbox so you don't see them.  Another useful tip is to archive all email that has been processed, rather than assuming anything that is read has been processed.  It is very useful to use a calendar, otherwise you will have a lot of trouble with the time component of task managing.  Having a clean desk area where everything is where it belongs reduces stress because you don't have to constantly and wastefully process.  You can schedule five hours a weak to process and end up saving many hours.  The reason you save time is because we are bad at multi-tasking and it is best to process 30 minutes to an hour worth of material rather than doing it for five minutes at a time many times each day.  Following time management advice can allow you to clear out all the tasks you need to do within one week of starting.  To do lists are usually inefficient, but work very well if you check the items off as soon as you schedule or process it.  If a task takes over fifteen minutes or is time sensitive you want to schedule it.  If it takes less than five minutes you should do it now.  Otherwise you should set up a task reminder.

		<h3>Excel Power Pivot</h3>
		<p>
			Power Pivot Excel is a very useful tool and works best for Windows Excel 2010, but also is available in more expensive versions of Windows Excel 2013 and 2016.  This program allows you to compute on over 20 million rows (if you use 64 bit) and join to many sheets easily.  You just drag and drop the relationships and join keys between sheets, then you can create interactive dashboards.
		</p>
		<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
		<p>
			Regular programming involves using if and else statements.  Machine learning uses correlation models with coefficients applied to polynomial values.  You give the program a training set and can come up with the right polynomial model and coefficients.  The polynomial model can be parametric or non-parameteric.  The non-parametric verison typically takes more data and has the benefit of not making assumptions about the best model.  The parameteric model has the benefit of taking less data to get a good model.  The non-parametric model typically tries to fit the data well without making too many curves.  
		</p>
		<h3>Linear Regression</h3>
		<p>
			Linear regression involves coming up with features to predict an outcome that is quantitative (a number).  The features that are highly correlated with the quantitiative number are used, and the interaction between the features (ie. feature 1 times feature 2, or feature1 squared) is considered with feature selection.  Usually if you use feature 1 times feature 2 you must use feature 1 and feature 2 separated as well by the hierarchical principle.  Once you get feature selection you can train it on past data.  The cost function is considered when fitting the model using a fit function.  The common cost function for linear regression is mean squared error.  You train it using cross validation.  Cross validation's goal is to accurately predict the test error.  The test error is the error you will expect to get when applying your model against new data.  Cross validation has many forms, but it is simplest to just use the 5-fold or 10-fold method.  All methods involve splitting up the training set and using it partially as a pretend test set.  The simple to understand version is half of the training set is the training set and the other half is treated as the test set.  You see if your model performed well on the pseudo-test set.  Another cross validation (CV) is the leave one out n times.  You train using all but one data point, then predict the last data point.  You do this n times for all n observations and see what your error rate was.  The 5-fold and 10-fold method describe how much you split up the data.  In the 5-fold CV you split it into five groups, you train with four groups and test against the last group, and repeat five times so every part is tested once and used for training four times each.  5-fold CV and 10-fold CV does well to predict the test error often, and is a quick go to method.  After fitting the model you can get new input and predict the expected output.  This is good for evaluating goods like houses given certain features like number of bathrooms, rooms, square feet, location.

		<h3>Logistic Regression</h3>
		<p>
			Logistic regression is somewhat similar to linear regression.  It predicts qualititive variables like "yes"/"no" to a question.  It has a different cost function that tends to have a breaking point in which once the features reach a certain point, the probability of the
